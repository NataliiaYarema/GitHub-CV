## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Nataliia, I am Data Analyst

### About me

I'm a highly motivated and fast-learning Data Analyst with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. With strong communication skills and a proactive mindset, I work independently and thrive in collaborative, results-driven environments.
Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning and professional development, constantly expanding my skills in SQL, Python, Google Analytics, Tableau, and Power BI. I enjoy simplifying complex data stories for non-technical stakeholders and helping teams make informed, data-backed decisions.
Always curious. Always improving.
